## Summary
The analysis shows that the average temperature in the month of June is 74.9F and December is 71.0F. This temperature is suitable for both businesses and are also times of the year with high amounts of travel, leading to those who don't regularly experience Oahu weather to become patrons to these businesses. From a perspective of just the raw data we have worked with for this module the temperature is viable. Factors that we may not have considered would be storm frequency, and ocean temperature that could have an impact on these businesses.
